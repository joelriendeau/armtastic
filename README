Collection of low-level C++ headers useful for embedded developement. In particular, the register.hpp classes cut down register writing/reading bugs because you no longer need to use masks when interacting with register adresses, you define all fields separately and access these objects instead. The masking is done automatically. You can even define permissions (R/W) for each subsection of the register so the compiler emits errors when the register is not used properly.
